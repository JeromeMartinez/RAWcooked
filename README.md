# RAWcooked

RAWcooked encodes RAW audio-visual data into the Matroska container (MKV), using the video codec FFV1 for the image and audio codec FLAC for the sound.

## Status

RAWcooked is ready for production. As with any other tool, keep doing basic checks e.g. testing reversibility with your own files.
